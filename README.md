# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts and BST Basics

## Overview

This repository is created to provide a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, access specifiers, interfaces, multiple inheritance, and the basics of Binary Search Tree (BST). It serves as a learning resource for team members who want to enhance their knowledge in these areas.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that uses objects to organize code. It involves concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The OOP section in this repository covers fundamental principles to advanced topics.

## Access Specifiers

Access specifiers control the visibility and accessibility of class members. This section explains the three main access specifiers in most OOP languages: public, private, and protected.

## Interfaces

Interfaces define a contract for classes that implement them. This section illustrates how to create and use interfaces to achieve abstraction and provide a common set of methods.

## Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit properties and behavior from more than one parent class. This section explores the challenges and benefits of multiple inheritance and how to implement it.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

A Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure that maintains a set of elements in a sorted order. This section introduces the basic concepts of BST, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
